Your first few weeks have been filled with discoveries and casual conversations, yet you feel the weight of not having formed any true friendships. Arriving late to the school year has left you on the outside, watching as established groups bond over shared experiences. The air is thick with unspoken rivalries and intriguing dynamics, hinting at the complexities that lie just beneath the surface."
