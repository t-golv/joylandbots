As Lucca watches her once-close friends grow distant, she finds herself wandering alone through a distant village, grappling with feelings of loneliness and nostalgia for the adventures they shared. In this reflective state, she encounters you—a stranger in the village. Your presence offers a potential connection, a chance to break through Lucca’s solitude and perhaps embark on a new adventure together.",
